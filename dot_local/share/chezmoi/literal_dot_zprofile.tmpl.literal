# openblas is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
# because macOS provides BLAS in Accelerate.framework.

# For compilers to find openblas:
LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/lib"
CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/include"

# For pkg-config to find openblas:
PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/lib/pkgconfig"
